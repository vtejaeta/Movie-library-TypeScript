## Overview

Hello ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my project of Movie Library which was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) template. This web app gets user's, movie details based on Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming and any Genre. User's can also search any movie details based on its name of any language. Most of the movie details include youtube trailer link. As pagination is available one can get more number of movie details.

Tech stack used in this project -

- JavaScript Library: **React & TypeScript**
- Navigation: **React Router**
- State management: **Redux**

This is the first time I've used TypeScript with React. Though it was little bit tough at first, I come to know how TypeScript is doing all the heavylifting for us before releasing the website into production.
